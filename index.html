    <p class="infowrite">A well-functioning democracy depends, in part, on the quality of people's political decisions. I am broadly 
      interested in understanding how and why people make political decisions in the manner that they do. My research examines how the media environment, in 
      combination with psychological processes, influences political decision making. My approach is interdisciplinary in nature, bringing 
      together concepts and data from behavioral, psychological, and neurobiological levels of analysis. I use a combination of techniques 
      including event-related potentials, eye movement monitoring, and tDCS to examine the psychological processes that underlie political decision making. 
      The overall goal of this research program is to understand the informational environments and psychological mechanisms that foster or inhibit people's 
      capacities to make sound decisions in a democracy.
