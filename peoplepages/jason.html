	My interdisciplinary program of research contributes to our understanding of how individuals learn and use political information. I use techniques from cognitive psychology and neuroscience to test theoretical propositions about political learning and decision-making that often cannot be adequately addressed using traditional survey and survey-experimental methods.  By using these techniques, I have been able either to confirm tenuous survey results, challenge those results, or pose new questions.  My work currently falls into three research categories: communicating prejudiced and stereotypic political information, remembering political information, and comprehending political information.<br><br>

	My interdisciplinary expertise is reflected in my publishing record, as my lead-authored papers have been published in flagship journals in three disciplines: communication (<i>Journal of Communication</i>, <i>Communication Research</i>, <i>Human Communication Research</i>), psychology (<i>Psychological Science</i>), and political science (<i>American Journal of Political Science</i>). I have also published in top subfield journals (<i>Political Communication</i>, <i>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</i>).<br><br>

	My work has received recognition from leading professional organizations, including the <i>Walter Lippmann Best Article of the Year Award</i> from the American Political Science Association, and <i>Top Paper Awards</i> from the International Communication Association and National Communication Association. This program of work has offered a fruitful training ground for junior researchers, yielding nine co-authored journal publications for seven graduate students and two undergraduate students who I trained in my lab. I serve on the editorial boards at the <i>Journal of Communication</i> and <i>Communication Research</i>.<br><br>

	I was previously an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2012 to 2013, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, having received my Ph.D. in Political Science at the University of Illinois in August 2012.<br><br>
